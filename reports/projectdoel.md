## Beschrijving

Beschrijf het doel en werking van je app.
Denk na over volgende zaken:
- wat is het doel van je app?

1. Provide truck drivers with the ability to create a cargo
2. Speak in their own language to communicate with the consignee/consignator and receive translations from AI.
3. Scan the QR code on the cargo to obtain its destination information, which can then be used for GPS navigation.
4. Obtain weather information for the destination from a third-party API.

- welk probleem lost je app op?

1. Language Barriers: Through the use of AI-powered translation features, the app breaks down language barriers between truck drivers and consignees/consignators, facilitating clearer and more effective communication across different languages.
2. Traffic Congestion: By integrating GPS navigation, the app helps truck drivers avoid traffic jams and route efficiently, saving time and reducing fuel consumption.
3. Safety Concerns: The app enhances safety by providing real-time weather information for the driver's destination. This allows drivers to be better prepared for adverse weather conditions, helping to avoid potential hazards.
4. Operational Efficiency: By enabling drivers to scan QR codes on cargos to instantly receive destination details, the app streamlines the process of loading and route planning. This speeds up the overall logistics chain and reduces the time trucks spend idling.
